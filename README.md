# goui-brew-tools
Hello World Application for [GOUI](https://github.com/Intermesh/goui) by [me](https://github.com/derjoachim).
This is a reimplementation of certain homebrew tools in Typescript, because it's a Friday afternoon.

Clone this repository and run from this directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8082 .

Happy brewing and coding!

Joachim
